              module.
	      Code written for firmware version 2.5

 Created by Cody B. Null, September 9, 2011
 Modified by Jordan Hochenbaum, Dec 5, 2011. (Version 1.5)
 Modified by Johan Korten, March 23, 2013. (Version 1.6)

 Version 1.4 - This version wrote specifically for 16x2
               Display.
               More display support coming in later version.

 Version 1.5 - Since mid 2011 the Arduino IDE has implemented the NewSoftSerial 
                library updates in the standard SoftwareSerial library and so 
                using NewSoftSerial is no longer needed. LCDKeypad has been updated 
                to use the Standard SoftwareSerial library. Also, Arduino 1.0
                support has been added. Backwards compatible with previous versions.

 Version 1.6 - Added support for the setType special command.
				This will help using different LCD's (2x16, 2x20, 4x16, 4x20).  
		      Added support for scrollLeft and scrollRight commands.

Version 1.7 - Completed the setType special command. 
 				Now the setCursor function works correctly.
 				Added keywords.txt and library.properties file.

 Note -	This library requires NewSoftSerial library
 The latest version of NewSoftSerial library can 
 always be found at http://arduiniana.org. -> NO LONGER NECESSARY. See V1.5 notes above
